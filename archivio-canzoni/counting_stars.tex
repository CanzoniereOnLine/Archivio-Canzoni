\capo{4}
\beginverse
\[A-]Lately, I've been, \[C]I've been losing sleep
\[G]Dreaming about the things that \[F]we could be
But \[A-]baby, I've been, \[C]I've been praying hard,
\[G]Said, no more counting dollars
\[F]We'll be counting stars, yeah \[F]we'll be counting stars
\endverse 
\beginverse 
I see this \[A-]life like a swinging vine
\[C]Swing my heart across the line
\[G]In my face is flashing signs
\[F]Seek it out and ye shall find
\[A-]Old, but I'm not that old
\[C]Young, but I'm not that bold
\[G]I don't think the world is sold
\[F]I'm just doing what we're told
\endverse 
\beginchorus
\[A-]I \[C]feel something so \[G]right
Doing the \[F]wrong thing
\[A-]I \[C]feel something so \[G]wrong
Doing the \[F]right thing
\[F]I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
\[F]Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
