\[G]Feels the way I \[F]do about you \[A-]now \[C] \[G] \[F]
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[A-] Backbeat the \[C]word is on the street
That the \[G]fire in your heart is \[F]out
\[A-] I'm sure you've \[C]heard it all before
But you \[G]never really had a \[F]doubt

\endchorus
\beginverse
And \[F]all the roads we \[G]have to walk along are \[A-]winding
And \[F]all the lights that \[G]lead us there are \[A-]blinding
\[F]There are many \[G]things that I would
\[C]Like to \[G]say to \[A-]you
But I don't know \[F]how \[D]

And \[F]after \[A-]all \[C] \[G]
You're my \[F]wonder\[A-]wall \[C] \[G] \[F]
