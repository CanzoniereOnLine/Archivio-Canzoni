\beginsong{Does your mother know}[by={Abba}]
\beginverse
\[G]You're so hot, teasing \[E-]me
\[G]So you're \[C]blue but I \[B-]can't take a \[A-]chance on a \[G]chick like \[D]you
That's something I couldn't do \[G]
\[G]There's that look in your \[E-]eyes
\[G]I can \[C]read in your \[B-]face that your \[A-]feelings are \[G]driving you \[D]wild
Ah, but girl you're only a child \[G]
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[C]Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're \[G]out?
\[C]And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're \[G]out?
\endchorus
\beginverse
Take it \[G]easy (take it easy)
Better \[C]slow down \[C-]girl
That's no \[G]way to \[C-]go
Does your \[G]mother \[C-]know?
Take it \[G]easy (take it easy)
Try to \[C]cool it \[C-]girl
Take it \[G]nice and \[C-]slow
Does your \[G]mother \[C-]know?
\endverse 
\beginverse
\[G]I can see what you \[E-]want
\[G]But you \[C]seem pretty \[B-]young to be \[A-]searching for \[G]that kind of \[D]fun
So maybe I'm not the one\[G]
\[G]Now you're so cute, I like your \[E-]style
\[G]And I \[C]know what you \[B-]mean when you \[A-]give me a \[G]flash of that \[D]smile (smile)
But girl you're only a child \[G]
\endverse 
\beginchorus
\[C]Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're \[G]out?
\[C]And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're \[G]out?
\endchorus 
\beginverse
Take it \[G]easy (take it easy)
Better \[C]slow down \[C-]girl
That's no \[G]way to \[C-]go
Does your \[G]mother \[C-]know?
Take it \[G]easy (take it easy)
Try to \[C]cool it \[C-]girl
Take it \[G]nice and \[C-]slow
