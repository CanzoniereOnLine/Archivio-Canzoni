\beginverse
\[E-] Another \[C]head hangs lowly, \[G]child is slowly \[D/F#]taken
\[E-] And the violence \[C]caused such silence, \[G]who are we mis\[D/F#]taken 
But you \[E-]see it's not me, it's not \[C]my family
In your \[G]head, in your head, they are figh\[D/F#]ting.
With their \[E-]tanks and their bombs and their \[C]bombs and their guns 
in your \[G]head, in your head, they are cry\[D/F#]ing 
\endverse
\beginchorus
In your \[E-]head, in your \[C]head, zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D/F#]bie 
What's in your \[E-]head, in your \[C]head, zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D/F#]bie

\beginverse
\[E-] Another \[C]mother's breaking \[G]heart is taking \[D/F#]over
\[E-] When the violence \[C]causes silence, \[G]we must be mis\[D/F#]taken
It's the \[E-]same old theme since \[C]1916
In your \[G]head, in your head, they're still figh\[D/F#]ting
With their \[E-]tanks and their bombs and their \[C]bombs and their guns
In your \[G]head, in your head, they're dy\[D/F#]ing

\beginchorus
In your \[E-]head, in your \[C]head, zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D/F#]bie 
What's in your \[E-]head, in your \[C]head, zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D/F#]bie
