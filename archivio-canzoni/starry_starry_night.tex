\beginsong{Starry starry night}[by={McLean}]
\beginverse
Starry, starry \[G]night
paint your pallet \[A-]blue and grey.
Look out on a \[C]summer's day \brk with \[D7]eyes that know the darkness in my \[G]soul.
Shadows on the hills, sketch the trees and the \[A-]daffodils
catch the breeze and the \[C]winter chills, \brk in \[D7]colours on the snowy linen \[G]land. \[C] \[G]
\endverse 
\beginchorus
And now I under\[A-]stand \[D7] \brk what you tried to \[G]say to me, \[E-]
how you suffered for your \[A-7]sanity, \[D7] \brk how you tried to set them \[E-]free.
They would not listen, they did \[A7]not know how \[A-7] \brk per\[D7]haps they listen \[G]now.
\endchorus 
\beginverse
Starry, starry \[G]night
flaming flowers \[A-]that brightly blaze
swirling clouds in \[C]violet haze \[D7] \brk reflect in Vincent's eyes of china \[G]blue.
Colors changing hue, morning fields of \[A-]amber grain
weathered faces \[C]lined in pain, \brk are \[D7]soothed beneath the artist's loving \[G]hand. \[C] \[G]
\endverse 
\beginchorus
And now I under\[A-]stand \[D7] \brk what you tried to \[G]say to me, \[E-]
how you suffered for your \[A-7]sanity, \[D7] \brk how you tried to set them \[E-]free.
They would not listen, they did \[A7]not know how \[A-7] \brk per\[D7]haps they listen \[G]now.
\endchorus 
\beginchorus
\[G]For they could not \[A-7]love you,\[D7] \brk but still your love was \[G]true \[E-]
and when no \[A-7]hope was left in sight \brk on that \[C-]starry, starry night.
You \[G]took your life as \[F7]lovers often do, \[E7] \brk but I \[A-7]could have told you Vincent,
this \[C]world was never meant for one as \[D7]beautiful as \[G]you.
\endchorus 
\beginverse
Starry, starry \[G]night
portraits hung in \[A-]empty halls,
frameless heads on \[C]nameless walls, \brk with \[D7]eyes that watch the world and can't for\[G]get.
Like the strangers that you've met, \brk the ragged men in \[A-]ragged clothes
the silver thorn, the \[C]bloody rose, \brk lie \[D7]crushed and broken on the virgin \[G]snow.
\endverse 
\beginchorus
And now I under\[A-]stand \[D7] \brk what you tried to \[G]say to me, \[E-]
how you suffered for your \[A-7]sanity, \[D7] \brk how you tried to set them \[E-]free.
They would not listen, they're not \[A7]listening still \[A-7] \brk per\[D7]haps they never \[G]will.
\endchorus
