\beginsong{Slipping through my fingers}[by={Abba}]
\capo{3}
\beginverse
\[G]Schoolbag in \[G-]hand
She leaves \[D]home in the \[F#-]early morning
\[G] Waving good\[G-]bye
With an \[D]absent-minded \[F#-]smile
\[G]I watch her \[G-]go
With a \[D]surge of that \[F#-]well-known sadness
\[G] And I have to \[A]sit down for a \[D]while
\endverse 
\beginchorus
The \[G]feeling that I'm \[A/C#]losing her for\[D]ever \[F#]
And \[G]without really \[A]entering her \[D]world \[D/F#]
I'm \[G]glad whenever  \[A/C#]I can share her \[D]laughter, that \[A4]funny lit\[A]tle \[D4]girl \[D] 
Slipping through my fin\[G]gers all the \[D]time
I try to \[F#-]capture every \[E-]minute
The \[G]feeling \[D]in it
Slipping through my \[A4]fingers \[A]all the \[D]time
Do I really \[G]see what's in her \[D]mind
Each time I \[F#-]think I'm close to \[E-]knowing
She \[G]keeps on gro\[D]wing
Slipping through my \[A4]fingers \[A]all the \[D]time
\endchorus 
\beginverse
\[G]Sleep in our \[G-]eyes
Her and \[D]me at the \[F#-]breakfast table
\[G] Barely \[G-]awake
\[D]I let precious time \[F#-]go by
\[G]Then when she's \[G-]gone
There's that \[D]odd melanc\[F#-]holy feeling
\[G]And a sense of \[A]guilt I can't \[D]deny
\endverse 
\beginchorus
What hap\[G]pened to the \[A/C#]wonderful \[D]adventures\[F#]
The \[G]places I had \[A]planned for us to \[D]go \[D/F#](slipping through my fingers all the time)
\[G]Well some of that we \[A/C#]did
But most we \[D]didn't
And \[A4]why I just don't \[D4]know \[D]
Slipping through my \[G]fingers all the \[D]time
I try to \[F#-]capture every \[E-]minute
The \[G]feeling \[D]in it
Slipping through my \[A4]fingers \[A]all the \[D]time
Do I really \[G]see what's in her \[D]mind
Each time I \[F#-]think I'm close to \[E-]knowing
She \[G]keeps on \[D]growing
Slipping through my \[A4]fingers \[A]all the \[D]time
\endchorus 
\beginverse
Some\[G]times I wish that \[A]I could freeze the \[D]picture \[F#]
And \[G]save it from the \[A]funny tricks of \[D]time
\[D/F#]slipping through my \[G]fingers \[A] \[D]
\[D] Slipping through my \[A4]fingers all the \[D]time
\endverse 
\beginverse
\[G]Schoolbag in \[G-]hand
She leaves \[D]home in the \[F#-]early morning
\[G] Waving good\[G-]bye with an \[D]absent-minded \[F#-]smile
\endverse
