\beginsong{Perfect}[by={Sheeran}]
\beginverse
I found a \[G]love for \[E-7]me
Darling just \[C]dive right in, and follow my \[D]lead
Well I found a \[G]girl beauti\[E-7]ful and sweet
I never \[C]knew you were the someone waiting for \[D]me
\endverse
\beginverse
Cause we were just kids when we \[G]fell in love
Not knowing \[E-7]what it was, I will not \[C]give you up this \[G]ti\[D]me
But darling just \[G]kiss me slow, your heart is \[E-7]all I own
And in your \[C]eyes you're holding \[D]mine
\endverse
\beginchorus
Baby, \[E-7]I'm \[C]dancing in the \[G]dark, with \[D]you between my \[E-7]arms
\[C]Barefoot on the \[G]grass, \[D]listening to our \[E-7]favorite song
When you \[C]said you looked a \[G]mess, I whispered \[D]underneath my \[E-7]breath
But you \[C]heard it, darling \[G]you look \[D]perfect to\[G]night

\beginverse
Well I found a \[G]woman, stronger than \[E-7]anyone I know
She shares my \[C]dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her \[D]home
I found a \[G]love, to \[E-7]carry more than just my secrets
To carry \[C]love, to carry children of our \[D]own
\endverse
\beginverse
We are still kids, but we're \[G]so in love, fighting \[E-7]against all odds
I know that we'll \[C]be alright this \[G]ti\[D]me
Darling just \[G]hold my hand, be my girl, I'll \[E-7]be your man
I see my \[C]future in your \[D]eyes
\endverse
\beginchorus
Baby, \[E-7]I'm \[C]dancing in the \[G]dark, with \[D]you between my \[E-7]arms
\[C]Barefoot on the \[G]grass, \[D]listening to our \[E-7]favorite song
When I \[C]saw you in that \[G]dress, looking so \[D]beautiful
I \[E-7]don't de\[C]serve this, darling \[G]you look \[D]perfect to\[G]night
