\beginsong{When it's time}[by={Green Day}]
\beginverse
\[G]Words get trapped in my \[D]mind,
sorry I don't \[E-]take the time to feel the way I \[C]do.
'cause the \[G]first day you came into my \[D]life,
all time ticks a\[G]round you \[D]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]But when I need your \[D]voice
and the key to unlock \[E-]all the love trapped in \[C]me
so tell me \[G]when it's \[D]time to say I lo\[G]ve you. \[G7]
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]All I want is \[G]you to understand,
that \[D]when I take your hand, it's 'cause I \[G]want to.
\[C]We are all born \[G]in a world of doubt.
but there's no \[D]doubt,
I figured \[D]out \[C]I \[C/B]love \[C/A]you. \[G]
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[G]I've been longing \[D]for
all the losers \[E-]that were meant to take the time to \[C]say,
what \[G]was really on their mind in\[D]stead
any time \[G]away.? \[D]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]Yet they'll never \[D]have
someone like you \[E-]to back down and help along the \[C]way.
\endverse

\beginverse
So tell \[G]me when it's \[D]time to say I lo\[G]ve you.
So tell \[G]me when it's \[D]time to say I \[C]love you. \[C/B] \[C/A] \[G]
\endverse
