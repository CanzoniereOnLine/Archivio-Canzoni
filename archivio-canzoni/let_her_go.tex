\beginchorus
You only need the \[C]light when it’s burning \[G]low,
only miss the \[D]sun when it starts to \[E-]snow,
only know you \[C]love her when you let her \[G]go. \[D]
Only know you’ve been \[C]high when you’re feeling \[G]low,
only hate the \[D] road when you’re missing \[E-]home,
only know you \[C]love her when you’ve let her \[G]go. \[D]
And you let her go.\[E-]    \[C]   \[D]   \[B-]   \[E-]    \[C]   \[D]

\beginverse
\[E-]Staring at the bottom of your \[C]glass,
hoping one \[D]day you will make a dream \[B-]last,
the dreams come \[E-]slow and goes so \[C]fast. \[D]
You \[E-]see her when you close your \[C]eyes,
maybe one \[D]day you will understand \[B-]why,
everything you \[E-]touch all it \[C]dies. \[D] - But
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E-]Staring at the ceiling in the \[C]dark,
same old \[D]empty feeling in your \[B-]heart,
‘cause love comes \[E-]slow and it goes so \[C]fast. \[D]
Well, you \[E-]see her when you fall a-\[C]sleep,
but never to \[D]touch and never to \[B-]keep,
because you loved her too \[E-]much and you dive \[C]too deep. \[D]

only miss the \[D]sun when it starts to \[E-]snow,
only know you \[C]love her when you let her \[G]go. \[D]
Only know you’ve been \[C]high when you’re feeling \[G]low,
only hate the \[D]road when you’re missing \[E-]home,
only know you \[C]love her when you’ve let her \[G]go. \[D]
And you let her \[E-]go, o-\[C]ho , o-\[D]ho!
And you let her \[E-]go, o-\[C]ho , o-\[D]ho!
Oh, you let her \[E-]go! \brk  \[C]   \[D]   \[B-]     \[E-]    \[C]   \[D] ‘Cause
