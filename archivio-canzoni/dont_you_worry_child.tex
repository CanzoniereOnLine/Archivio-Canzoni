\beginsong{Don't you worry child}[by={Swedish house mafia}]
\transpose{2}
\beginverse 
There was a \[A-]time, I used to look into my father's \[F]eyes
In a happy \[A-]home, I was a king I had a golden \[F]throne               
Those days are \[G]gone, now the \[A-]memories are on the \[F]wall
I hear the \[G]songs from the \[A-]places where I was \[F]born
\endverse 
\beginchorus 
\[A-]Up on the hill, across the blue \[F]lake,
That's where I had my first heartb\[A-]reak
I still remember how it all \[F]changed
\[F]My father said
\[G]Don't you \[A-]worry, don't you worry c\[F]hild
\[F]See heaven's got a plan for you
\[G]Don't you \[A-]worry, don't you worry \[F]now
\[F]Yeah!
\[G]Don't you \[A-]worry, don't you worry c\[F]hild
\[F]See heaven's got a plan for you
\[G]Don't you \[A-]worry, don't you worry \[F]now
\[F]Yeah!
\endchorus 
\beginverse 
There was a \[A-]time, I met a girl of a different k\[F]ind
We ruled the \[A-]world, I thought I'll never lose her out of s\[F]ight,
We were so \[G]young, I t\[A-]hink of her now and \[F]then
I still hear the \[G]songs rem\[A-]inding me of a \[F]friend
\endverse

\[A-]Up on the hill, across the blue \[F]lake,
That's where I had my first heartb\[A-]reak
