\beginsong{All about that bass}[by={Trainor}]
\beginchorus
Because you know I'm \[A]all about that bass, 
\[A]'Bout that bass 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm \[B-]all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm \[E]all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm \[A]all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
\endchorus 
\beginverse
\[A]Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size 2
\[B-]But I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do
\[E]'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
\[A]All the right junk in all the right places
\[A]I see the magazines working that Photoshop
\[B-]We know that shit ain't real
\[B-]Come on now, make it stop
\[E]If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
\[A]'Cause every inch of you is \[D]perfect
From the \[A]bottom to the top
\endverse 
\beginchorus
\[A]Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your \[B-]size
She says, \[E]boys they like a little more booty to hold \[A]at night
\[A]You know I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie\[B-] doll,
\[E]So, if that's what's you're into 
Then go a\[D]head and move \[A]along! 
Because you know I'm \[A]all about that bass, 
\[A]'Bout that bass 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm \[B-]all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm \[E]all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm \[A]all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
\endchorus 
\beginverse
\[A]I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny \[B-]bitches Hey!
No, I'm just playing I know you \[E]think you're fat,
\[A]But I'm here to tell you that,
\[E]Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the\[A] top!
