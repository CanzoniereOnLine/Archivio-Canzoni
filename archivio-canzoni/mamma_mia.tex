\beginsong{Mamma mia}[by={Abba}]
\beginverse
\[D]I've been cheated by you since I don't know \[G]when
\[D]So I made up my mind, it must come to an \[G]end
\[D5]Look at me now, \[D+5]will I ever learn?
\[D6]I don't know how \[D7]but I suddenly lose con\[G]trol
\[G]There's a fire within my \[A]soul
\endverse 
\beginchorus
\[G]Just \[D]one \[A]look and I can hear a bell ring
\[G]One \[D]more \[A]look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh
\[D]Mamma mia, here I go again
\[G]My my, how can I resist you?
\[D]Mamma mia, does it show again?
\[G]My my, just how much I've missed you
\[D]Yes, I've been \[A]brokenhearted
\[B-]Blue since the \[F#-]day we parted
\[G]Why, why \[A]did I ever let you go?
\[D]Mamma mia, \[B-]now I really know,
\[G]My my, \[A]I could never let you go.
\endchorus 
\beginverse
\[D]I've been angry and sad about things that \[G]you do
\[D]I can't count all the times that I've told \[G]you "we're through"
\[D5]And when you go,\[D+5]when you slam the door
\[D6]I think you know \[D7]that you won't be away \[G]too long
\[G]You know that I'm not that\[A] strong
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G]Just \[D]one \[A]look and I can hear a bell ring
\[G]One mo\[D]re \[A]look and I forget everything
\[D]Mamma mia, here I go again
\[G]My my, how can I resist you?
\[D]Mamma mia, does it show again
\[G]My my, just how much I've missed you?
\[D]Yes, I've been\[A] brokenhearted
\[B-]Blue since the \[F#-]day we parted
\[G]Why, why \[A]did I ever let you go?
\endchorus
\beginchorus
\[D]Mamma mia, \[B-]even if I say
\[G]"Bye bye\[A], leave me now or never"
\[D]Mamma mia, it's a game we play
\[G]"Bye bye" doesn't mean forever
\[D]Mamma mia, here I go again
\[G]My my, how can I resist you?
\[D]Mamma mia, does it show again
\[G]My my, just how much I've missed you?
\[D]Yes, I've been\[A] brokenhearted
\[B-]Blue since the \[F#-]day we parted
\[G]Why, why \[A]did I ever let you go?
\[D]Mamma mia, \[B-]now I really know
\[G]My my, \[A]I could never let you go
\endchorus
